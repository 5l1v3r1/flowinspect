[ ] flowinspect - A framework for network traffic inspection
	[ ] killtcp
	[ ] tcp session tracking starts from handshake
	[ ] udp session tracking needs testing
	[x] tcp -T should operate on flows and not packets
	[ ] shellcode inspection needs CTS OR STC not BOTH
	[ ] merge show{tcp, udp}matches
	[ ] code cleanup { delete object when done using, remove duplicate/unnecessary objects, ... }
	[x] make dfa memberids optional
	[ ] offset corrupts the packet span calculation
	[ ] span offsets don't include custom offset (2 instead of 1002)
	[ ] CORE DUMP: ./flowinspect.py -p ../sigframework/PCAP-Generation-Tools/output/test.bin/HTTP_GET_raw_raw.pcap -C '.*ead2.googlesyndi.*' -C '.*test' -b32 -V -E
	[ ] LOOP: ./flowinspect.py -p osx_bind_udp.pcap -E -V
	[ ] rework on partial/final match display
	[ ] invert match meta output should be more sensible
