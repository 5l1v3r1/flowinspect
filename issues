[ ] flowinspect - A framework for network traffic inspection
    [x] linemode should not honor inspection specific flags (offset, depth, ...)
    [x] pcap write wont work in linemode
    [x] invertmatch not working for regex and shellcode inspection modes
    [x] -T should operate on flows and not packets
    [x] make dfa memberids optional
    [x] nonzero offset corrupts packet span calculation
    [x] span offsets don't include custom offset (2 instead of 1002)
    [x] ip flow tracking should be in sync with tcp flow tracking
    [x] direction identification for UDP flows needs more work
    [ ] multimatch offsets are incorrect for ANY direction
    [ ] -y should accept path
    [ ] -z and -Z should accept path
    [x] cli to disable banner/summary
    [ ] killtcp needs more testing
    [ ] udp session tracking needs more testing
    [ ] merge show{tcp, udp}matches if appropriate
    [ ] code cleanup {delete object when done using, remove duplicate/unnecessary objects, ...}
    [x] multimatch not working with yara
    [x] packet offset not shown for fuzzy match
    [x] fuzzy match ratio not shown in meta output
    [ ] packet count fails when yara gives multiple matches
