[ ] flowinspect - A framework for network traffic inspection
	[ ] ip flow tracking should be in sync with tcp flow tracking
	[ ] direction identification for UDP flows needs more work
	[ ] linemode should not honor inspection specific flags (offset, depth, ...)
	[ ] dfa graph should be generated independent of match status
	[x] pcap write wont work in linemode
	[ ] invertmatch not working for regex (test with others as well)
	[ ] multimatch offsets are incorrect for ANY direction
	[ ] -y should accept path
	[ ] -z and -Z should accept path
	[ ] killtcp needs more testing
	[ ] udp session tracking needs more testing
	[x] -T should operate on flows and not packets
	[ ] merge show{tcp, udp}matches if appropriate
	[ ] code cleanup {delete object when done using, remove duplicate/unnecessary objects, ...}
	[x] make dfa memberids optional
	[x] nonzero offset corrupts packet span calculation
	[x] span offsets don't include custom offset (2 instead of 1002)
