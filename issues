[ ] flowinspect - A framework for network traffic inspection
	[ ] dfa graph should be generated independent of match status
	[x] pcap write wont work in linemode
	[ ] invertmatch - NOT WORKING FOR REGEX
	[ ] multimatch offsets are incorrect for ANY direction
	[ ] shellcode inspection should be CTS/STC/ANY
	[ ] -y should accept path
	[ ] -z and -Z should accept path
	[ ] killtcp
	[ ] udp session tracking needs testing
	[x] tcp -T should operate on flows and not packets
	[ ] merge show{tcp, udp}matches
	[ ] code cleanup { delete object when done using, remove duplicate/unnecessary objects, ... }
	[x] make dfa memberids optional
	[x] offset corrupts the packet span calculation
	[x] span offsets don't include custom offset (2 instead of 1002)
