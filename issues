killtcp, is it working?
tcp session tracking starts from handshake, is it right?
udp session tracking needs testing
tcp -T should operate on flows and not packets
exitstats should include flow insp/match counts and not packet insp/match counts (for TCP)
shellcode inspection needs CTS OR STC not BOTH
