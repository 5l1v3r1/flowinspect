[ ] flowinspect - A framework for network traffic inspection
    [x] network/pcap based flow extraction (pynids)
    [x] tcp.kill
    [x] invert match
    [x] ignore 0 byte matches
    [x] disable inspection - linemode
    [x] support for multiple patterns
    [x] write/append matched packets/streams to a file
    [x] add snort-like content modifiers (offset-depth)
    [x] support for different cts, stc and any patterns
    [x] out modes: quite, meta, hex, ascii, raw (+write)
    [x] stats (longest/shortest match and packet/stream #)
    [x] stop tracking a stream when a match is found (tcp.collect = 0)
    [x] cli to switch the first-match behavior
    [x] inspection modes:
        [x] regex
        [x] pylibemu
            [x] libemu profile output
            [x] libemu memory size cli
        [x] pyyara (peid/clamav)
        [x] fuzzy match (fuzzywuzzy)
        [ ] hash (ssdeep/md5/sha/...)
        [ ] ip reputation
        [ ] js deobfuscation analysis
        [ ] file format validity (PDF/Flash/Jar/OLE/audio/video/...)
        [ ] pefile/elffile/peepdf/...
        [ ] clamav/virustotal/anubis/wepawet/jsunpack/threatxpert
        [ ] TaintDroid/DroidBox/Androguard/apktool
    [x] udp stream tracking (cts/stc/any)
    [x] show matching tcp packet ids (handy when pattern spans many packets)
    [x] write matching flows to pcap
        [x] write all packets in a matched flow (ones coming after match as well)
        [x] write packets seen only untill the match happened (+a few more)
    [x] ip/tcp/udp header checks - via BPF
    [x] use colors if term supports
    [x] verbose should be incremental
    [x] include bpf expression for matching flows (verbose >= 3)
    [ ] sequence diagram for matched streams (nodes, data flow, packet ids, streamids, data size, ...)
    [ ] shellcode inspection should be CTS/STC/ANY
    [ ] prefer re2 over re
    [ ] boolean parser for all modes
    [ ] combination of inspection modes
    [ ] timetamped (non)debug output
    [ ] file extraction over HTTP/SMTP/IMAP/POP3/FTP/TFTP/...
    [ ] ssl decryption via user certificates
    [ ] configuration file support
    [ ] enable logging support
