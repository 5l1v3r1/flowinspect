[x] tcp.kill
[x] invert match
[x] prefer re2 over re
[x] ignore 0 byte matches
[x] disable inspection - linemode
[x] support for multiple patterns
[x] write/append matched packets/streams to a file
[x] add snort-like content modifiers (offset-depth)
[x] support for different cts, stc and any patterns
[x] out modes: quite, meta, hex, ascii, raw (+write)
[x] stats (longest/shortest match and packet/stream #)
[x] stop tracking a stream when a match is found (tcp.collect = 0)
[ ] pcap write (with mods to header fields, regex replace, ...)
[ ] inspection modes:
	[ ] search
	[x] dfa
	[x] regex
	[x] libemu
	[ ] yara (peid/clamav)
[x] udp stream tracking (cts/stc/any)
[x] show matching tcp packet ids (handy when pattern spans many packets)
[ ] ip/tcp/udp header checks
[ ] CFG for shellcode
[ ] state transition graph for regex
[ ] boolean expressions parser
[ ] shellcode inspection should enable disassembled output (should auto include a new shellcode outmode)
