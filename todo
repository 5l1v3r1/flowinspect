[x] invert match
[x] ignore 0 byte matches
[x] tcp.kill
[x] disable inspection - linemode
[x] stats (longest/shortest match and packet/stream #)
[x] support for different cts, stc and any patterns
[x] support for multiple patterns
[x] out modes: quite, meta, hex, ascii, raw (+write)
[x] write/append matched packets/streams to a file
[x] add snort-like content modifiers (offset-depth)
[x] stop tracking a stream when a match is found (tcp.collect = 0)
[ ] out modes should use colors (only when stdout is a tty) to highlight matched bytes
[ ] write matched packets/streams to a pcap file (like in py-greppcap)
[ ] prefer re2 over re
